# PWA Text Editor

## Description

A text editor that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. It features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline.

## Usage 

Upon opening the application in VSCode a client/server folder structure is present.

When the text application is run in the terminal the the backend starts and is served to the client, the javascript files are bundled using webpack, and a HTML file, service worker and a manifest file is generated.
